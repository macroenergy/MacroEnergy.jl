# Adding a Location to an existing System

Adding a new Location to a System requires two steps:

1. Add the new Location to the list of Locations
2. Tag any Nodes you wish to assign to the Location

## Adding the Location to the Location list

The Location list is a JSON file containing an array of Location names. Each name should be unique.

The most straightforward way of adding a new Location is to use the template functions. 

You can add one or more Locations by providing the Location file as an argument:

```julia
template_location("ExampleSystems/template_example/system/locations.json", "Boston")
template_location("ExampleSystems/template_example/system/locations.json", ["Boston", "NYC", "Princeton"])
```

Or by providing the associated System:

```julia
template_location(system, ["Boston", "NYC", "Princeton"])
```

You can learn how to create or load the System here: [Creating a System](@ref)

With either approach, doing so will leave you with the following Locations file:

```json
{
    "locations": [
        "Boston",
        "NYC",
        "Princeton"
    ]
}
```

Macro will ignore duplicate Locations. If we next call:

```julia
template_location(system, ["Boston", "New London", "Princeton"])
```

Our locations file will be:

```json
{
    "locations": [
        "Boston",
        "NYC",
        "Providence",
        "New London"
    ]
}
```

Alternatively, you can directly add names to the locations.json file. However, in the future, the template functions will take care of additional steps so we recommend using them whenever possible.

## Adding Nodes to a Location

The next step is to let Macro know which Nodes are part of your new Location.  

In your Nodes file (at system/nodes.json by default), add a "location" field to the instance data of each Node you would like to include, and the name of the Location. A guide on how to add a Node to a System can be found here: [Adding a Node to an existing System](@ref)

For example, if you have a three-Location system and each Location requires an Electricity Node, you could add the following:

```json
{"nodes": [
    {
        "type": "Electricity",
        "global_data": {
            "time_interval": "Electricity",
            "max_nsd": [
                1
            ],
            "price_nsd": [
                5000.0
            ],
            "constraints": {
                "BalanceConstraint": true,
                "MaxNonServedDemandConstraint": true,
                "MaxNonServedDemandPerSegmentConstraint": true
            }
        },
        "instance_data": [
            {
                "id": "elec_SE",
                "location": "SE",
                "demand": {
                    "timeseries": {
                        "path": "system/demand.csv",
                        "header": "Demand_MW_z1"
                    }
                }
            },
            {
                "id": "elec_MIDAT",
                "location": "MIDAT",
                "demand": {
                    "timeseries": {
                        "path": "system/demand.csv",
                        "header": "Demand_MW_z2"
                    }
                }
            },
            {
                "id": "elec_NE",
                "location": "NE",
                "demand": {
                    "timeseries": {
                        "path": "system/demand.csv",
                        "header": "Demand_MW_z3"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]}
```

The Location information must be added to the instance data, not the global data, as you can only have one Node of each Commodity at any given Node.

To include two or more Nodes of the same Commodity at a single Node, you must use sub-Commodities to define additional versions of the Commodity.

You can learn more about sub-Commodities here.

For example, if you wish to differentiate between high and low emission electricity, you could create two sub-Commodities: LowEmissElectricity, and HighEmissElectricity. Now, you can add Electricity, LowEmissElectricity, and HighEmissElectricity to a Location:

```json
{"nodes": [
    {
        "type": "Electricity",
        "instance_data": {
            "id": "elec_SE",
            "time_interval": "Electricity",
            "location": "SE",
            "demand": {
                "timeseries": {
                    "path": "system/demand.csv",
                    "header": "Demand_MW_z1"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "LowEmissElectricity",
        "instance_data": {
            "id": "lowemisselec_SE",
            "time_interval": "LowEmissElectricity",
            "location": "SE",
            "demand": 0
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "HighEmissElectricity",
        "instance_data": {
            "id": "highemisselec_SE",
            "time_interval": "HighEmissElectricity",
            "location": "SE",
            "demand": 0
        }
    },
]}
```

As a reminder, sub-Commodities can flow into Nodes of the same type or one of their supertypes types. This means LowEmissElectricity can flow into LowEmissElectricity Nodes or Electricity Nodes. However, HighEmissElectricity and Electricity cannot flow into LowEmissElectricity Nodes.

Also, if you connect an Asset producing LowEmissElectricity to our new "SE" Location, it will be connected to the LowEmissElectricity Node. If you want the LowEmissElectricity to be able to meet the Electricity demand then you will have to specify that the Asset be connected to the "elec_SE" Node, or add an edge connecting the "lowemisselec_SE" and "elec_SE" Nodes.

## Important Settings for Locations

There are two important settings when using Locations in your System:

- AutoCreateLocations: default = true. When set to true, this feature will automatically create a new Location if Macro comes across a Node which is a assigned to a Location that does not exist. Macro will print an info statement to let the user know that the Location has been created and its name.

- AutoCreateNodes: default = false. When set to true, this feature will automatically create a new Node if Macro is asked to find a Node of a given Commodity at a Location and the Node does not exist. For example, if Macro is asked to find the Electricity Node in "location 1", but that Location only has a Hydrogen Node, then a new Electricity Node will be created with the default parameters.
