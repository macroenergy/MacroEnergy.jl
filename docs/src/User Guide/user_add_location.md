# Adding a Location to an existing model

- Add the location to locations.json
- Add instance data for the required Nodes
- Maybe, create Node types
- Add columns to the availability, demand, prices CSVs
- Add instances to the asset files (JSON or CSV)
- ...

Make sure we have a link to descriptions of all the Node attributes, including those not used in the example
