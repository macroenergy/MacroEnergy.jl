# Tutorials

The tutorials in this section are long-form explanations of how to use Macro. They are intended to help you learn to complete full workflows with Macro, as opposed to being convenient references for specific tasks. Each step of the tutorial is written out in full, rather than linking to the relevant guides. Most also have Jupyter notebooks to make it easier to follow the tasks.

We currently have the following tutorials:

1. **Getting Started**: Shows you how to download, install, and test Macro.
2. **Running Macro**: Describes how to optimize an electricity grid, write the results, and plot them. It will then show you how to add an emission limit to the system.
3. **Multisector Modelling**: Show you how to add a hydrogen sector model to the electricity grid from the previous tutorial. You will then optimize the multisector system, write and plot the results.
