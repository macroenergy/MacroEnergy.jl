# Macro Input Data
*Macro version 0.1.0*

Macro input files are organized into **three** main directories:

- **[Settings folder](@ref)**: Contains all the settings for the run and the solver.
- **[System folder](@ref)**: Contains all files related to the system, such as sectors, time resolution, nodes, demand, etc.
- **[Assets folder](@ref)**: Contains all the files that define the assets, such as transmission lines, power plants, storage units, etc.

In addition to these folders, the user should provide a [`system_data.json`](@ref) file that contains the paths to the input folders and files. 

As a result, the folder structure for a Macro case should be as follows:

```

```

!!! note "Units in Macro"
    Macro is agnostic to the units of the input data. Special attention should be paid to the units of the transformation parameters (e.g., conversion efficiency, fuel-to-energy production, etc.). It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the units are consistent across the system input data.

    The following table shows the **default units** of the input data that are used, for instance, in the example system provided with the package:

    | **Sector/Quantity** | **Units** |
    | :-----------------: | :---------: |
    | **Electricity** | MWh |
    | **Hydrogen** | MWh |
    | **NaturalGas** | MWh |
    | **Uranium** | MWh |
    | **Coal** | MWh |
    | **CO2** | ton |
    | **CO2Captured** | ton |
    | **Biomass** | ton |
    | **Time** | hours |
    | **Price** | USD |

    Commodities that require only an energy representation (e.g., Hydrogen) have units of MWh.
    Commodities that require a physical representation (e.g., Biomass, where regional supply curve is important) have units of metric tonnes.
    The recommended convention is MWh on a higher heating value basis for transformations where hydrogen is involved, and tonnes on a dry basis for transformations where biomass is involved.

!!! warning "Comments in JSON files"
    The comments (e.g. `//`) in the JSON file examples are for illustrative purposes only. They should be removed before using these lines as input, as JSON does not support comments.

In the following section, we will go through each folder and file in detail.

## Settings folder
The `settings` folder currently contains only one file, `macro_settings.yml`, which contains the settings for the run.

### macro_settings.json
**Format**: JSON

| **Attribute** | **Values** | **Default** | **Description** |
|---------------| :-----------------: | :---------: |-----------------|
| ConstraintScaling | True, False | False | If true, the model will scale the optimization model constraints to make it more numerically stable. |
| WriteSubcommodities | True, False | False | If true, the model will write the subcommodities created by the user in the results. |
| OverwriteResults | True, False | False | If true, the model will overwrite the results file if it already exists. |
| OutputDir | String | "results" | The directory where the results will be saved. |

## System folder
The `system` folder currently contains five main files:

- [commodities.json](@ref): Defines the sectors/commodities used in the system.
- [time_data.json](@ref): Defines the time resolution data for each sector.
- [nodes.json](@ref): Defines the nodes in the system.
- [demand.csv](@ref): Contains the demand data.
- [fuel_prices.csv](@ref): Contains the prices of fuels.

### commodities.json
**Format**: JSON

This file contains a list of sectors/commodities used in the system. The file is a list of string for each sector/commodity:

```json
{
    "commodities": [
        "Sector_1",
        "Sector_2",
        ...
    ]
}
```

**Example**: Energy system with electricity, hydrogen, natural gas, CO2, uranium, and coal sectors:

```json
{
    "commodities": [
        "Electricity",
        "Hydrogen",
        "NaturalGas",
        "CO2", 
        "Uranium",
        "Coal"
    ]
}
```

### time_data.json
**Format**: JSON

This file contains the data related to the time resolution for each sector. The file is structured as follows:

```json
{
    "PeriodLength": <Integer>,  // units: hours
    "HoursPerTimeStep": {
        "Sector_1": <Integer>,  // units: hours
        "Sector_2": <Integer>,  // units: hours
        ...
    },
    "HoursPerSubperiod": {
        "Sector_1": <Integer>,
        "Sector_2": <Integer>,
        ...
    },
    "SubPeriodMap": {
        "path": <String>, // relative path to the period map file
    },
    "TotalHoursModeled": <Integer> // units: hours
}
```

| **Attribute** | **Values** | **Description** |
|---------------| :-----------------: |-----------------|
| PeriodLength | Integer | Total number of **hours** in the simulation. |
| HoursPerTimeStep | Integer | Number of **hours** in each time step **for each sector**. |
| HoursPerSubperiod | Integer | Number of **hours** in each subperiod **for each sector**. |
| SubPeriodMap | String | Relative path to the period map file. For an example of the period map file, see [Period_map.csv](https://github.com/macroenergy/Macro/blob/main/ExampleSystems/eastern_us_three_zones/system/Period_map.csv). |
| TotalHoursModeled | Integer | Total number of **hours** modeled. **Note**: When using representative periods, this parameter is used to compute the weight of each subperiod. |

!!! note "Subperiods"
    Subperiods represent the time slices of the simulation used to perform time wrapping for time-coupling constraints (see, for example, [MacroEnergy.timestepbefore](@ref)).

**Example**: Energy system modeled for three weeks, with one hour per time step, and one week per subperiod:

```json
{
    "PeriodLength": 504,  // 3 weeks
    "HoursPerTimeStep": {
        "Electricity": 1,
        "Hydrogen": 1,
        "NaturalGas": 1,
        "CO2": 1,
        "Uranium": 1,
        "Coal": 1
    },
    "HoursPerSubperiod": {
        "Electricity": 168,  // 1 week
        "Hydrogen": 168,
        "NaturalGas": 168,
        "CO2": 168,
        "Uranium": 168,
        "Coal": 168
    },
    "SubPeriodMap": {
        "path": "three_weeks/Period_map.csv"
    },
    "TotalHoursModeled": 8760
}
```

`Period_map.csv`:
```
| Period_Index | Rep_Period | Rep_Period_Index |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| 1            | 6          | 1                |
| 2            | 6          | 1                |
| 3            | 6          | 1                |
| 4            | 6          | 1                |
| 5            | 6          | 1                |
| 6            | 6          | 1                |
| 7            | 6          | 1                |
| 8            | 6          | 1                |
| 9            | 6          | 1                |
| 10           | 17         | 2                |
| ...          | ...        | ...              |
```

In this example, Macro uses the above input files to create the following parameters:
- **Total time interval**: `[1:PeriodLength] = [1:504]`
- **`HoursPerTimeStep`**: `1` for all sectors
- **Subperiods**:
  1. `[1:168]`: first week
  2. `[169:336]`: second week
  3. `[337:504]`: third week
- **Period map**: 
    This file assigns each week of the `TotalHoursModeled` to one of the representative periods. 
    For instance: 
    - `week 1` -> `6th representative period`
    - `week 2` -> `6th representative period`
    - `week 3` -> `6th representative period`
    - `week 10` -> `17th representative period`
    - etc.
- **Weight of each subperiod**: 
  1. `[1:168]` -> `18.0495`
  2. `[169:336]` -> `21.0577`
  3. `[337:504]` -> `13.0357`

    This value is used to 'weight' each hour of the subperiods in the operational model.

The formula used to compute the weight of each subperiod is:

```math
w_i = \alpha * n_i
```

where $\alpha$ is a scaling factor defined as:

```math
\alpha = \frac{TotalHoursModeled}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} HoursPerSubperiod * n_i}
```
and $n_i$ is the number of times the $i$-th representative period is used in the period map to model periods, and $N$ is the total number of representative periods.

!!! note "Weights without period map"
    If the period map is not provided, the weights are set to 1 for each representative period.

### nodes.json
**Format**: JSON

This file defines the regions/nodes for each sector. It is structured as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary defines a network for a given sector. 

Each dictionary has three main attributes:
- `type`: The type of the network (e.g. "NaturalGas", "Electricity", etc.).
- `global_data`: attributes that are the same for all the nodes in the network.
- `instance_data`: attributes that are different for each node in the network.

This structure for the network has the advantage of **grouping the common attributes** for all the nodes in a single place, avoiding to repeat the same attribute for all the nodes.

This is the structure of the `nodes.json` file:

```json
{
    "nodes": [
        {
            "type": "NaturalGas", // NaturalGas network
            "global_data": {},    // attributes that are the same for all the nodes in the network
            "instance_data": [
                // NaturalGas node 1 ...
                // NaturalGas node 2 ...
                // ...
            ]
        },
        {
            "type": "Electricity", // Electricity network
            "global_data": {},     // attributes that are the same for all the nodes in the network
            "instance_data": [
                // Electricity node 1 ...
                // Electricity node 2 ...
                // ...
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The attributes that can be set for each node (either in `global_data` or `instance_data`) are the following:

| **Attribute** | **Type** | **Values** | **Default** | **Description** |
|:--------------| :------: | :------: | :------: |:-------|
| **id** | `String` | `String` | Required | Unique identifier for the node. E.g. "elec\_node\_1". |
| **type** | `String` | Any Macro commodity type | Required | Commodity type. E.g. "Electricity".|
| **time_interval** | `String` | Any Macro commodity type | Required | Time resolution for the time series data linked to the node. E.g. "Electricity".|
| **constraints** | `Dict{String,Bool}` | Any Macro constraint type | Empty | List of constraints applied to the node. E.g. `{"BalanceConstraint": true, "MaxNonServedDemandConstraint": true}`.|
| **demand** | `Dict` | Demand file path and header | Empty | Path to the demand file and column name for the demand time series to link to the node. E.g. `{"timeseries": {"path": "system/demand.csv", "header": "Demand_MW_z1"}}`.|
| **max_nsd** | `Vector{Float64}` | Vector of numbers $\in$ [0,1] | [0.0] | Maximum allowed non-served demand for each demand segment as a fraction of the total demand. E.g. `[1.0]` for a single segment. |
| **max_supply** | `Vector{Float64}` | Vector of numbers | [0.0] | Maximum allowed supply for each supply segment. E.g. `[1000.0]` for a single segment. |
| **price** | `Dict` | Price file path and header | Empty | Path to the price file and column name for the price time series to link to the node. E.g. `{"timeseries": {"path": "system/fuel_prices.csv", "header": "natgas_SE"}}`.|
| **price_nsd** | `Vector{Float64}` | Vector of numbers | [0.0] | Price/penalty for non-served demand by segment. E.g. `[5000.0]` for a single segment. |
| **price_supply** | `Vector{Float64}` | Vector of numbers | [0.0] | Piecewise linear price for supply curves. E.g. `[0.0, 100.0, 200.0]`. |
| **price\_unmet\_policy** | `Dict{DataType,Float64}` | Dict of Macro policy types and numbers | Empty | Price/penalty for unmet policy constraints. |
| **rhs\_policy** | `Dict{DataType,Float64}` | Dict of Macro constraint types and numbers | Empty | Right hand side of the policy constraints. E.g. `{"CO2CapConstraint": 200}`, carbon price of 200 USD/ton. |

!!! tip "Constraints"
    One of the main features of Macro is the ability to include constraints on the system from a pre-defined library of constraints (see [Macro Constraint Library](@ref) for more details). To include a constraint to a node, the user needs to add the constraint name to the `constraints` attribute of the node. The example below will show how to include constraints to node instances. 

**Example**: the following is an example of a `nodes.json` file with both electricity, natural gas, CO2 and biomass sectors covering most of the attributes present above. The (multiplex)-network in the system is made of the following sub-networks:
- NaturalGas (three nodes)
    - `natgas_SE`
    - `natgas_MIDAT`
    - `natgas_NE`
- Electricity (three nodes)
    - `elec_SE`
    - `elec_MIDAT`
    - `elec_NE`
- CO2 (one node)
    - `co2_sink`
- Biomass (one node)
    - `bioherb_SE`

Therefore, the system has 4 networks and 8 nodes in total.

```json
{
    "nodes": [
        {
            "type": "NaturalGas",
            "global_data": {
                "time_interval": "NaturalGas" // time resolution as defined in the time_data.json file
            },
            "instance_data": [
                {   // NaturalGas node 1
                    "id": "natgas_SE",

                            "header": "natgas_SE" // column name in the price file for the price time series
                        }
                    }
                },  // End of NaturalGas node 1
                {   // NaturalGas node 2

                        }
                    }

                        80
                    ]

In this example, `BalanceConstraint`, `MaxNonServedDemandConstraint`, and `MaxNonServedDemandPerSegmentConstraint` are applied to all the nodes in the electricity network. In particular, the `MaxNonServedDemandConstraint` limits the maximum amount of demand that can be unmet in a given time step, and the `MaxNonServedDemandPerSegmentConstraint` limits the maximum amount of demand that can be unmet in each demand segment. In addition, the `CO2CapConstraint` is applied to the $\text{CO}_2$ node to model a greenfield scenario with a carbon price of 250 USD/ton.

### demand.csv
**Format**: CSV

This file contains the demand data for each region/node. 

- **First column**: Time step.
- **Remaining columns**: Demand for each region/node (units: MWh).

##### Example:

| TimeStep | Demand_MW_z1 | Demand_MW_z2 | Demand_MW_z3 |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1        | 100          | 200          | 300          |
| 2        | 110          | 210          | 310          |
| ...      | ...          | ...          | ...          |

### fuel_prices.csv
**Format**: CSV

This file contains the prices for each fuel for each region/node.

- **First column**: Time step.
- **Remaining columns**: Prices for each region/node (units: USD/MWh).

##### Example:

| TimeStep | natgas_SE | natgas_MIDAT | natgas_NE |

| ...      | ...       | ...           | ...       |

## Assets folder
The `assets` folder contains all the files that define the resources and technologies that are included in the system. As a general rule, each asset type has its own file, where each file is structured in a similar way to the `nodes.json` file. 

### Asset files
**Format**: JSON

Similar to the `nodes.json` file, each asset file has the following three main parameters:
- `type`: The type of the asset (e.g. "Battery", "FuelCell", "PowerLine", etc.).
- `global_data`: attributes that are the same for all the assets of the same type (e.g., unit commitment constraints applied to all the power plants).
- `instance_data`: attributes that are different for each asset of the same type (e.g., investment costs, lifetime, etc.).

Depending on the graph structure of the asset, both `global_data` and `instance_data` can have different attributes, one for each transformation, edge, and storage present in the asset. 

!!! tip "Example: natural gas power plant"
    For example, a natural gas combined cycle power plant is represented by an asset made of: 
    - **1 transformation** (combustion and electricity generation)
    - **3 edges** 
        - natural gas flow
        - electricity flow
        - CO2 flow

    Then, both `global_data` and `instance_data` will have the following structure:
    ```json
    {
        "transforms":{
            // ... transformation-specific attributes ...
        },
        "edges":{
            "elec_edge": {
                // ... elec_edge-specific attributes ...
            },
            "fuel_edge": {
                // ... fuel_edge-specific attributes ...
            },
            "co2_edge": {
                // ... co2_edge-specific attributes ...
            }
        }
    }
    ```

In the following sections, we will go through each asset type and show the attributes that can be set for each of them.
Each section will contain the following three parts:
- **Graph structure**: a graphical representation of the asset, showing the transformations, edges, and storages present in the asset.
- **Attributes**: a table with the attributes that can be set for each asset type.
- **Example**: an example of the asset type file (`.json`).

## `system_data.json`
**Format**: JSON

This file contains the paths to the input folders and files, and is structured as follows:

```json
{
    "commodities": {
        "path": "system/commodities.json"
    },
    "locations": {
        "path": "locations"
    },
    "settings": {
        "path": "settings/macro_settings.json"
    },
    "assets": {
        "path": "assets"
    },
    "time_data": {
        "path": "system/time_data.json"
    },
    "nodes": {
        "path": "system/nodes.json"
    }
}
```
