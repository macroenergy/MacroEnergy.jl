# Guides

The guides in this section are short instructions for how to complete specific tasks with Macro. They are intended as a reference for your day-to-day work. In them, you will find descriptions of how to use Macro's features and components but detailed descriptions of each are left to the [Manual](@ref).

We have organized the guides into three sections, one for each of our user profiles:

- **Users**: Want to create and optimize a real-world system using Macro. They will be able to do this with little or no coding, and not have knowledge of Macro's components or internal structure.
- **Modelers**: Want to add new Assets, Commodities or public policies to Macro. They will need to be able to code in Julia and understand some of Macro's components, but not have knowledge of the internal structure or underlying packages.
- **Developers**: Want to change or add new features, model formulations or Constraints to Macro. They will require detailed knowledge of Macro's components, internal structure, and underlying packages.

You can use the navigation panel to the left of your screen to find the task you are looking to accomplish.
